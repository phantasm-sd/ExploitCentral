This once hosted a collection of solutions to Gera's Insecure Programming examples found at https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~riccardo/sec/
-- Some solutions were posted to the One ABO A Week Blog comments: https://oneaboperweek.wordpress.com/2010/04/12/stack-warmup-2-solution/#comments
-- But the original repo appears lost and will need to be recreated at a later time.
