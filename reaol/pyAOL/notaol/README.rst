Notaol
======

Notaol is a work-in-progress client implementation of AOL's communication protocol P3 and display convention FDO.

Updated 6/16/22

This project appears to have been abandoned 8 years ago. I've cloned the noaol repo as of the date above and have started to update the broken pieces and see if I can get this to work.

Hopefully, this will be able to manage the connection and FDO operations communicating with re-AOL: http://reaol.org

If not, hopefully I've learned something.

Quick Start
===========

Notaol is written for Python 3.4 or greater.
It is being updated to run on Python 3.8 or later.

1. ``pip3 install crcmod``
2. ``python3 -m notaol.rpc`` <--You may see warnings here.
3. Open a new terminal, console or screen session
4. *Telnet* or *Netcat* to localhost on port 5000.
5. Type ``{"command": "connect", "username": "someguy", "password": "password1"}`` on telnet.
6. See some logging on the Python process.
7. Type CTRL+], Enter, CTRL+D to quit telnet.

More to come!
